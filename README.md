# Postie (Alpha)

Postie is a (minimalistic) Postman alternative which allows to test/ consume APIs

If compiled to an exe it requires no installation, no registration and no fuss. (Pre-compiled version availible under releases)

Some parts use the Ace editor (https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace) to neatly present declarative languages (jSON, XML)
